Fun with pseudo-slots

The purpose of this game is to aid in making contemplative decisions involving specific quantities in a single container. For instance, if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure how much you wish to spend on sweets out of the money you have in your pocket, you can use this game. That way, you can play a game to determine your savings / spending.

If you don't play a game like this in that situation, the problem is, you will set a pattern - for instance, perhaps you decide to save your money. Well, sometimes, it's good to spend a little more money, but since you've already set the pattern, you won't necessarily have that opportunity. This game alleviates this problem.
